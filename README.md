Hi, I'm Tobi 👋, a 18-year-old aspiring application developer. I'm currently in a 4-year apprenticeship 👨‍💻, with the first year at ZLI Zürich 🏫 and the remaining years at Bank Vontobel 💼. I'm gaining hands-on experience in software development and learning how to apply my skills in both educational and professional environments.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym 🏋️‍♂️ and gaming 🎮. I'm passionate about coding, problem-solving, and I'm excited to see how technology shapes the future, especially in the world of finance and innovation! 🚀
